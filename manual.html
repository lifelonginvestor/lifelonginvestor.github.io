        <p>While an investment strategy should be driven primarily by your goals, financial situation, timeline, and risk tolerance. It should
          still consider any opportunities to manage, defer, and reduce taxes which may help you build wealth faster (additional ~1%+ per year).</p>
        <p>There are several different levers to operate: selecting investment products, timing of buy and sell decisions, choosing tax-deferred
          accounts, taking advantage of losses, funding education expenses, and charitable giving.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Tax losses:</b> A loss on the sale of a security can be used to offset any realized investment gains, and then up to $3,000 in taxable
          income annually. Some tax-loss-harvesting strategies try to take advantage of losses for their tax benefits when rebalancing the portfolio,
          but be sure to comply with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules on the tax treatment of gains and losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Loss carryforwards:</b> In some cases, if your losses exceed the limits for deductions in the year they occur, the tax losses can be
          "carried forward" to offset investment gains in future years.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Capital gains:</b> Securities held for more than 12 months are taxed as long-term gains or losses with a top federal rate of 23.8%
          (versus 40.8% for short-term gains). Being conscious of holding periods is a simple way to avoid paying higher tax rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Fund distributions:</b> Mutual funds distribute earnings from interest, dividends, and capital gains every year. Shareholders are likely
          to incur a tax liability if they own the fund on the date of record for the distribution in a taxable account, regardless of how long they
          have held the fund. Therefore, mutual fund investors considering buying or selling a fund may want to consider the date of the distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tax-exempt securities:</b> Tax treatment for different types of investments varies. For example, municipal bonds are typically exempt
          from federal taxes, and in some cases receive preferential state tax treatment. On the other end of the spectrum, real estate investment
          trusts and bond interest are taxed as ordinary income—with rates up to 37% for the top income tax bracket in 2018. Sometimes, municipal
          bonds can improve after-tax returns relative to traditional bonds. Investors may also want to consider the role of qualified dividends as
          they weigh their investment options. Like long-term capital gains, qualified dividends are taxed at a top rate of 23.8% (long-term capital
          gain rate of 20% plus the 3.8% Medicare surtax). Qualified dividends are subject to the same tax rates as long-term capital gains, which are
          lower than rates for ordinary income.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Fund or ETF selection:</b> Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) vary in terms of tax efficiency. In general, passive funds tend
          to create fewer taxes than active funds. While most mutual funds are actively managed, most ETFs are passive, and index mutual funds are
          passively managed. What's more, there can be significant variation in terms of tax efficiency within these categories. So, consider the tax
          profile of a fund before investing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Retirement accounts:</b> Retirement accounts (401(k)/403(b)) can offer a potential double dose of tax advantages—contributions you make
          may reduce your current taxable income (if income eligibility requirements are met), and any investment growth is tax-deferred. After age
          70½, however, there are required minimum distributions (RMDs). 2019 Annual contribution limits: $19,000 per year per employee If age 50 or
          above, $25,000 per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>IRA accounts:</b> With a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars, but investment gains are tax-deferred, and
          withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, provided you hold the account for 5 years and meet one of the following conditions: you are age 59½
          or older, are disabled, make a qualified first-time home purchase (lifetime limit $10,000), or have died. Roths have no RMDs during the
          lifetime of the original owner so they can also be useful vehicles for estate planning. 2019 Annual contribution limits: $6,000 per year If
          age 50 or above, $7,000 per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tax-deferred annuity:</b> Most tax-advantaged accounts have strict annual contribution limits and required minimum distribution rules. If
          you are looking for additional tax-deferred savings, you may want to consider tax-deferred annuities, which have no IRS contribution limits
          and are not subject to RMDs. No contribution limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>529 savings plans:</b> 529 accounts will allow you to save after-tax money, but get tax-deferred growth potential and federal income
          tax-free withdrawals when used for qualified expenses including college and, since 2018, also up to $10,000 per student per year in
          qualified K–12 tuition costs. The maximum contribution limit for New York's 529 Program (Direct) is $375,000. Up to $10,000 is deductible
          annually from New York State taxable income for married couples filing jointly; single taxpayers can deduct up to $5,000 annually. <br>
          The 529 plans owned by college students or their parents count as assets and reduce need-based aid by a maximum of 5.64 percent of the
          asset’s value. That means if you have $20,000 in a college-savings plan for your daughter, her aid would be reduced by roughly $1,100. For
          financially independent students who hold their own 529 plans, the assessment is a far larger 20 percent, that’s not typical. but the
          tax-free investment gains you've earned in your 529 account could likely outweigh this tiny loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Health savings accounts (HSAs)</b> Health savings accounts allow you to save for health expenses in retirement. These accounts have the
          potential for a triple tax benefit—you may be able to deduct current contributions from your taxable income, your savings can grow
          tax-deferred, and you may be able to withdraw your savings tax-free, if you use the money for qualified medical expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Charitable giving:</b> Contribute appreciated stock instead of cash; Contribute real estate or privately held business interests (e.g.,
          C-corp and S-corp shares; LLC and LP interests); Accelerate your charitable giving in a high-income year with a donor-advised fund.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Asset Location Strategy</h2>
        <p>Bonds, with the exception of tax-free municipal bonds and US Saving Bonds, are generally highly tax-inefficient, because they generate
          interest payments that are taxed at ordinary income rates. Potentially higher returning types of fixed income investments, such as US High
          Yield and Emerging Markets Debt, are the most tax-inefficient.</p>
        <p>REITs are also rated low on the tax-efficiency scale. That's because they are required by law to pay out at least 90% of their taxable
          income, and, unlike other equities, this income is generally taxed at higher ordinary income rates.</p>
        <p>Generally you may want to consider putting the most tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and the least in tax-deferred
          accounts like a traditional IRA, 401(k), or deferred annuity, or a tax exempt account such as a Roth IRA (see table below).</p>

          <p>Set up you backdoor Roth IRA if necessary.</p>
          <p>To balance your portfolio, think to use your savings first, instead of selling.</p>
          <p>Use your tax-deferred accounts 401(k), 403(b) or Roth IRA to do more aggressive growth investment.</p>

          <p class="title">Unwavering Saving to Invest</p>
          <p>A lifetime based on the habit of thrift--spending less than you might and deferring the spending you do--is essential to saving.</p>
          <p>"Pay yourself first" by putting money into savings on a regular basis.</p>
          <p>Borrowing with a mortgage is very different from "being in debt."</p>

          <p class="title">Financial Literacy</p>
          <p>If you want to get rich, you need financial literacy which is the ability use knowledge and skills to manage financial resources
            effectively for a lifetime of financial well-being.</p>
          <p>That means being able to understand how to balance a budget, buy a home, fund your children's college education, save for your own
            retirement, avoid bankruptcy, use debt wisely, and assess and choose form a pool of complex financial products. Furthermore, when the time
            comes, it means making sure you have enough retirement income for as long as you live.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="readnote">
          <p class="title">Qualified Dividends</p>
          <p>Qualified dividends are generally dividends from shares in domestic corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations which you
            have held for at least a specified minimum period of time, known as a holding period. Another requirement is that the shares be unhedged;
            that is, there were no puts, calls, or short sales associated with the shares during the holding period.</p>
          <p>Qualified dividends are reported on Form 1099-DIV in line 1b or column 1b. However, not all dividends reported on those lines may
            have met the holding period requirement. Those non-qualified dividends, as well as other ordinary dividends, may be taxed at your ordinary
            income tax rate, which can be as high as 37%.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Holding periods:</b>The fund must have held the security unhedged for at least 61 days out of the 121-day period that began 60 days
            before the security’s ex-dividend date. (The ex-dividend date is the date after the dividend has been paid and processed and any new
            buyers would be eligible for future dividends.) The same for your stocks.
          </p>
          <p>Consider this hypothetical situation in which you have dividends reported on Form 1099-DIV as qualified from shares in XYZ fund, the
            form shows $1,800 in column 1a and $900 in 1b (Qualified Dividend). You purchased 10,000 shares of XYZ fund on April 27 of the tax year.
            You sold 2,000 of those shares on June 15, but continue to hold (unhedged at all times) the remaining 8,000 shares. The ex-dividend date
            for XYZ fund was May 2. Therefore, during the 121-day window, you held 2,000 shares for 49 days (from April 28 through June 15) and 8,000
            shares for at least 61 days (from April 28 through July 1). Your eligible qualified dividends would be: $900 * 80% = $720.</p>

        <div class="readnote">
          <p class="title">Passive Investing Philosophy</p>
          <p>Sensible investors embrace passively managed index funds. Ultimately, a passive index fund managed by a not-for-profit investment
            management organization represents the combination most likely to satisfy investor aspirations.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Bogleheads</b>
          </p>
          <p>“Money buys a whole lot more than food, clothing, and shelter. It’s the power symbol of society. Money buys freedom, possessions,
            status, access, opportunities, experiences, and more choices. How people spend their time is a good indication of what they value most.
            You may have noticed that most of us who are employed spend half or more of our waking hours pursuing the almighty dollar. To be sure,
            most of us work for more than just money. But how many of us would get up and go to work every day if we weren’t paid?”</p>
          <p>The lower rates on qualified dividends increase the tax-efficiency of stocks relative to bonds whose yield is taxed at ordinary
            income tax rates. For this reason, and the fact that stocks benefit from the lower capital gains tax rates, we generally recommend placing
            stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.</p>
          <p>Roth suggests putting bond funds in a tax-deferred account, like 401(k) or IRA, while keeping the stock funds in a taxable account.
            The reason is that bond fund distributions are taxed at whatever rate applies to your income, which means that every year there will be a
            tax hit. That adds up over time. There's also no guarantee that stock funds will outperform bond funds (or vice versa) or that interest
            rates will remain as low as they are, so the simplest thing is to defer the taxes until you withdraw the money.</p>
          <p>We suggest that the best solution to this problem in taxable accounts is to use low-cost, low-turnover, tax-efficient index funds
            that do not depend on the skill (or luck) of stock-picking managers. They are tax efficient and low cost, reflect their benchmark index,
            and can be held indefinitely.</p>

          <p class="title">Semiactive Investing Strategy</p>
          <p>
            <b>Ben Graham:</b>
          </p>
          <p>“The art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally appreciated. A creditable, if unspectacular, result can be
            achieved by the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to improve this easily attainable standard requires much
            application and more than a trace of wisdom.”</p>
          <p>
            <b>Sir John Templeton</b>
          </p>
          <p>“Bull markets are born in pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the
            best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.”</p>
          <p>“To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are avidly buying requires the greatest of fortitude and pays
            the greatest ultimate rewards.“</p>
          <p>“If you want to have a better performance than the crowd, you must do things differently from the crowd.”</p>
          <p>
            <b>Howard Marks </b>
          </p>
          <p>“We have to practice defensive investing, since many of the outcomes are likely to go against us. It’s more important to ensure
            survival under negative outcomes than it is to guarantee maximum returns under favorable ones.”</p>
          <p>“Prices are too high” is far from synonymous with “the next move will be downward.” Things can be overpriced and stay that way for a
            long time . . . or become far more so.”</p>
          <p>“There’s only one way to describe most investors: trend followers. Superior investors are the exact opposite. Superior investing, as
            I hope I’ve convinced you by now, requires second-level thinking—a way of thinking that’s different from that of others, more complex and
            more insightful.”</p>
          <p>“Buying something for less than its value. In my opinion, this is what it’s all about—the most dependable way to make money. Buying
            at a discount from intrinsic value and having the asset’s price move toward its value doesn’t require serendipity; it just requires that
            market participants wake up to reality. When the market’s functioning properly, value exerts a magnetic pull on price.”</p>
          <p>The quest in value investing is for cheapness. Value investors typically look at financial metrics such as earnings, cash flow,
            dividends, hard assets and enterprise value and emphasize buying cheap on these bases. The primary goal of value investors, then, is to
            quantify the company’s current value and buy its securities when they can do so cheaply.</p>
          <p>Growth investing lies somewhere between the dull plodding of value investing and the adrenaline charge of momentum investing. Its
            goal is to identify companies with bright futures. That means by definition that there’s less emphasis on the company’s current attributes
            and more on its potential.</p>
          <p>There’s more. If you’ve settled on the value approach to investing and come up with an intrinsic value for a security or asset, the
            next important thing is to hold it firmly. That’s because in the world of investing, being correct about something isn’t at all synonymous
            with being proved correct right away.</p>
          <p>Value investors score their biggest gains when they buy an underpriced asset, average down unfailingly and have their analysis proved
            out. Thus, there are two essential ingredients for profit in a declining market: you have to have a view on intrinsic value, and you have
            to hold that view strongly enough to be able to hang in and buy even as price declines suggest that you’re wrong. Oh yes, there’s a third:
            you have to be right.</p>
          <p>The riskiest things: The greatest risk doesn’t come from low quality or high volatility. It comes from paying prices that are too
            high. This isn’t a theoretical risk; it’s very real.</p>
          <p class="chart">
            <img width="50%" alt="A brilliant risk-return chart" src="img/charts/return-vs-risk.jpg">
          </p>
          <p>As you move to the right, increasing the risk: the expected return increases (as with the traditional graphic), the range of possible
            outcomes becomes wider, and the less-good outcomes become worse.</p>
          <p>The one thing I’m sure of is that by the time the knife has stopped falling, the dust has settled and the uncertainty has been
            resolved, there’ll be no great bargains left. When buying something has become comfortable again, its price will no longer be so low that
            it’s a great bargain.</p>
          <p>You’ll do better if you wait for investments to come to you rather than go chasing after them. You tend to get better buys if you
            select from the list of things sellers are motivated to sell rather than start with a fixed notion as to what you want to own. An
            opportunist buys things because they’re offered at bargain prices. There’s nothing special about buying when prices aren’t low.</p>
          <p>To satisfy those criteria, an investor needs the following things: staunch reliance on value, little or no use of leverage, long-term
            capital and a strong stomach. Patient opportunism, buttressed by a contrarian attitude and a strong balance sheet, can yield amazing
            profits during meltdowns.</p>
          <p>“Because ensuring the ability to survive under adverse circumstances is incompatible with maximizing returns in the good times,
            investors must choose between the two.”</p>
